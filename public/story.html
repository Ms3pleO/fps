<h1>Our Story</h1>
<p>At Funky Pig Farm, pig farming is not just a livelihood; it’s a way of life. Growing up, we watched our father nurture and grow a backyard piggery with care, expertise, and a sense of community. His dedication inspired us to take his small-scale business to new heights, turning it into the thriving piggery farm you see today.
  Our journey is a tribute to his memory and to all the lessons he taught us. Every pig we raise and every customer we serve carries forward his legacy.</p>

<p>Located in the heart of San Rafael, Bulacan, Funky Pig Farm carries on a legacy of dedication, hard work, and love for pig farming. More than just a business, our farm is a tribute to a great man—our father—who passed away two years ago but left us a wealth of knowledge, passion, and a dream to continue what he started</p>
